# Multi-App-Runner
App that opens multiple apps. Once you close the app, when you reopen it your apps will be saved
How it works: Whenever you add a file to be opened, it makes a text file that stores the data of that app on it. WHenever you add another app, instead of making a new file, it deletes what is on that file and adds the updated apps to it.
